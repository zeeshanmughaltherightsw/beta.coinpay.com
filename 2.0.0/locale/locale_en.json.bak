    "title": "About Cointopay",
    "description": "Cointopay is a bootstrapped startup company started in 2014 with limited development time during the Christmas holidays of 2013. Our main driver is to provide innovative modern payment services based on the new crypto currencies, also known in the media as magical internet money BitCoin. We are a legitimate business and not politically driven to devaluate the Dollar/Euro. We do think that an alternative to the native payment method will drive up competition and ultimately be beneficial for the general public. Cointopay is a Crypto Coin Payment service provider for businesses and charity organizations. We see a future of financial transactions for alternative currencies like BitCoin at very low fees, secure, instant and very easy and we want to be part of that transition.<br><br>The days of 2014 and 2015 were a magical time where everything was possible, people involved were early adopters still. Things started to change in 2016 but the real breakthrough came in 2017 where a tipping point was reached. Since 2017 the industry has matured a lot. We hope that we have contributed moving forward into the future of open finance. Being seven years in the industry we have a lot of background in a young industry, let the next period be a period of bloom. Live it, love it, while marching on towards endless opportunities."
